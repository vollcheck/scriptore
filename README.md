# scriptore

Process source (messy PDFs) to generate structures accessible
for further application processing.

### Platform agnostic (let's use more buzzy words)

Ability to make said structure available in different formats

- EDN - as we're coming from Clojure world
- JSON - as everybody else loves it

Results are available in `out/` directory.
