# scriptore

## Goals

### Process

Process source (messy PDFs) to generate structure accessible
for further application processing (webdev?).

### Platform agnostic (let's use more buzzy words)

Ability to make said structure available in different formats

- EDN - as we're coming from Clojure world (superior to JSON tbh from CLJ perspective)
- JSON - as everybody else loves it

Both of these files are available in `out/` directory.
